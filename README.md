My answers to the logic puzzles
I was able to do every problem besides the PID (don't have enough experience in computer science or egineering to tackle that problem). 
For the extrta credit, I had the computer run through every available outcome to get from the top right to the bottom left and it would 
print out the lowest sum, unfortunately I did not have time to allow the user to input the array. The coin problems were extremely simple 
and I used the common methods of attack (I was able to set up some JOptionPanes for those two projects). I proud of my work because I just 
started programming and was able to complete most of the problems so thank you for your time looking at this code. Enjoy!
